        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a full time college student who has always been passionate about her studies. The idea of being successful goes further into receiving diplomas, but it goes deeper into discovering who I am as a person and what I truly enjoy doing, the experiences i have had, the struggles i have encountered and most importantly the friendships and networks I have made. Apart from my expertise on applying to schools, I hope to further my knowledge beyond the academic criteria and further into what it means to be part of the working life. This way I learn and make mistakes and very significantly, learn and be a better human being. I know that we are not all born perfect, but to me it does not hurt to fix one's defects here and there.<br><br>
         My greatest gift of them all is my ethnicity and background, I come from an amazing and beautiful culture that has allowed me to be open and accepting of others. Not only have I been able to share amazing traditions of being part of a mexican race, but I have learned about other cultures. Being able to connect and meet individuals from different races is something, again, I am passionate about. I believe that the more we know about the human race the better since it will open our minds to embrace and cherish other beautiful languages and traditions. Speaking about languages, I have been gifted with the ability to speak two languages fluently, spanish and english. This amazing skill is something I have always and will continue to embrace since it shows two parts of me that i am proud of. However, i do not wish to stop there. I hope to learn ASL pretty soon and get certified that way I can serve as an interpreter to others. My idea of learning languages is to be able to build genuine connections with those speak it but also to serve as a helping hand when they struggle to communicate with those who do not understand it. Therefore, through time, I can have my trilingual skills to help me achieve a job that I will be passionate about. <br><br>

        Becoming part of a team is something that I hope and wish to accomplish. I believe that working as a team leads to better and more beneficial results to whatever the issue is. I began an intership at a probation department that showed me how significant it is to have a team with you when dealing through difficult situations, It is not necessarily about intellectual help but the support one gives to someone. I hope to be able to experience such relationships. Apart from all these skills and abilities, I would like to emphasize my love for helping people. I enjoy speaking out for others and guiding towards the best path possible, which in this case is God's path. Living not only a spiritual life but a life of righteousness has helped me significantly and I hope to help others in the same way.
